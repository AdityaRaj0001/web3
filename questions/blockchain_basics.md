## Q - Describe briefly what are Bitcoin, Ethereum and Chainlink?

### Bitcoin
It was the first protocol to popularize blockchain, made peer-to-peer transactions possible without the involvement of any intermediary. It introduced the concept of decentralized digital currency.

### Ethereum
Ethereum expanded on bitcoin's technology by introducing smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with all the terms and conditions written into the code. These contracts are trust-minimized agreements, and they remove the need for intermediaries. The Ethereum platform also allows the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that can interact with the blockchain and real-world data through decentralized networks.

### Chainlink
A decentralized network that helps in the creation of hybrid smart contracts. Hybrid because it combines on-chain logic with off-chain data and computation, keeping both the logic and data decentralized.

## Q - What are the key advantages of smart contracts over traditional financial systems?

✅ **Decentralization** - They operate on decentralized networks maintained by nodes, thus removing the need for central intermediaries.

✅ **Transparency and Flexibility** - All transactions and contract executions on the blockchain are visible to everyone. Also, pseudo-anonymity ensures privacy is maintained, not tied to real-life identities.

✅ **Security and Immutability** - Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be altered. Hacking a blockchain is extremely challenging due to its decentralized nature compared to centralized systems where you're targeting a central authority.

✅ **Reduced Counterparty Risk** - Smart contracts remove the need for trust in intermediaries, ensuring that agreements are executed as coded without the risk of human interference or fraud.
